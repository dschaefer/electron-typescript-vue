# Seed for Electron projects that use Vue.js and Typescript

I've become a Vue.js fan. It matches closely to my ideal of using custom elements
and a good template engine to build componentized UI.

The Vue community is also adding pretty good TypeScript support with add-ons.

This seed moulds that into an Electron project that uses webpack to translate
Vue and TypeScript into two JavaScript files, one for the Electron main and one
for the renderer.

TODO: Add in testing using Mocha/Chai including Unit and e2e.
Still figuring out what the right approach is for these in the Electron context.

TODO: Also lots of Vue.js examples show off webpack's hot reload capability.
Need to see what makes sense with Electron.
